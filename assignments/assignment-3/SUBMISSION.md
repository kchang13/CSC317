# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
Certain parts of the AI websites look crooked and unpolished. I don't think it can find a combination of colors that are easy on the eyes and pleasant to look at. However, the code looks alot neater than compact than mine.

## Lessons Learned
I didn't know the AI can generate complete, working websites. It can be used to quickly see what my own content will look like superimposed on websites/templates I like.

## Preferred Version
I can't say I have a preferred version, because I did poorly on this assignment. I was busy at work these past few weeks as I was refused a schedule adjustment. I will re-do this assignment separately as practice. I apologize, This won't happen again.
