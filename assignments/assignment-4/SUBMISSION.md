## Comments
I originally tried using <button> but messed it up. I understand parts of it might be inefficient and would like some feedback on it.

The calculator looks giant when accessing it from Github Pages but looks fine when dropped into a browser. I'm not sure why.

I wasn't able to use the extra time as I was unavailable from 4/17 to 4/20 for a business trip and associated overtime. The recent tariffs have seriously affected my job.

Apologies for the late submission.
